-automatically: easy but limmited 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-git deals with editing of codes and projects which could be very complex, diffrent files in a project usually tend to be tightly connected.
